# GitHub API Integration
The project includes a feature to display the number of followers and avatar from a GitHub account. This is handled in the loader function of React Router DOM, which fetches the data from the GitHub API.

# Example Loader Function:

import { json, useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";

export async function loader() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/yourusername');
  const data = await response.json();
  return json({ followers: data.followers });
}
# Example Component Usage:

import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";

function GitHubFollowers() {
  const { followers } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>GitHub Followers: {followers}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
